                                    SALSA is a simple yet, elegant and graceful dance form. It is often related with walking in a sense that anyone who can walk can do Salsa. Learning how to Salsa gives you confidence to step on the dance floor and overcome the fear of dancing. It builds self-confidence, discipline and concentration. It is a great hobby that also makes people social and outgoing. It gives you freedom to move, to dream with your feet and teaches you to perform as a team and to inspire others.

                                    The classes are open to all, whether local or foreigner, teenager or adult.

                                    There is no age bar for the salsa classes. Age will mere define the limitation on difficulty level of moves you can learn and the ability to grasp things. Our students tend to range quite widely between late teens to those in their late 50's, with the vast majority falling between 16's to 45's.
                                </p>

                                    If you fall anywhere outside this box, we recommend you to take private classes so that we can adopt on your strengths and weaknesses. If you want to teach Salsa to your children, consider adding them to our children's private batch. Please <a href="#contacts">contact</a> the instructors for more suggestions.

                                    No, not at all. You don't need a partner to enroll. Normally, guys and ladies sign up as individuals but dance as partners in the class. You will rotate/switch with each other in the class so everyone can have a go.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, if you are signing up as a couple and you don't want to switch, we are fine. Just tell the teacher your preference of not rotating partners before each class.  
                                    
                                  </p>
                                <p>  Having said that, we highly encourage you to change partners, as you never know what you or your partner is missing out or doing wrong until you dance with different people. Dancing with everyone speeds and improves your abilities and gives you a true sense of partner dancing.

                                    </p><p>
    It is something that you don't have to worry about because our classes are designed to rotate partners every few minutes.
    If you stay by yourself for a little while you will have a partner on the next rotation.
</p><p>
    We invite our students from other levels if the numbers are different. We do our best to get even numbers.

                                    <strong>Clothes:</strong> Wear comfortable and clean clothes. We have separate changing rooms for male and female so it is also possible to change at the studio if you come directly from your workplace or college.

                                    <strong>Shoes:</strong> For the first few months, use flat shoes, sneakers, converse, party shoes that won't slip on the floor or grip too much. For ladies, heels with ankle straps are recommended as long as you are comfortable. Later on you can buy proper Jazz or Latin dance shoes. 
                                    </p><p>Dance shoes are a great investment as we have noticed that students with proper footwear tend to learn without any difficulties and injuries.</p>

                                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Please remember that you are dancing with a partner so personal hygiene is important. Please use deoderant and breath fresheners. Don't take it personally if anyone suggests you to do so. If you smell good, it is always nice and pleasant.

                                <p>Each dance school has its own syllabus and its own way of naming the levels. The only thing that really counts is how many hours you have spent on the dance floor learning and more importantly practicing your steps. Sometimes, our students who have danced for six months dance better than people dancing from 2 years.</p>

                                    Levels are differentiated to keep the standard syllabus and teach in a systematic manner.

                                    If you are complete beginner and think you have two left feet, we recommend that you start with level 1. We call it a Beginner's batch (Level 1 and 2) and normally we have new batches every month.

Let's see how you go and if you catch up faster, we can shift you up to higher levels.

After assessment we can recommend you a suitable batch and timings if you intend to join the regular classes. Normally, the assessment takes place on Saturdays during the weekly practice session (or open floor) from 5 pm to 6:30 at the studio where people from different level come and dance with each other. The assessment should only take around 10-15 minutes.

                                    Of course, you can watch any classes during the class hours. If you tell the instructor that you want to watch a class, we don't have any issue with it. Check which levels we are running from the class schedule and come along.

You will get a better picture of what the classes are like and what could suit you best.</p><p>The first class is always free and if you don't like it you don't have to sign for a whole course.</p>

                                <p>Due to daily class schedule, we wouldn't be able to offer you catch up classes in a separate class. If you miss one or two class you can still cover up by coming to weekly practice sessions or in the consecutive class as we revise previous classes' steps before we move forward.</p>
                                <p>If you miss over 40% of the course, you can repeat the level without any additional charges. However, we cannot keep the remaining membership for you for more than 3months.</p>
